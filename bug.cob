01  WS-AREA. 
    05  WS-COUNT PIC 9(5) VALUE 0. 
    05  WS-TABLE OCCURS 100 TIMES. 
       10  WS-ITEM PIC X(50). 

* The issue is that there is no check on the number of entries before accessing the array.
* This can lead to a subscript out of range error if more than 100 items are added to the table.
* In COBOL, this would be a runtime error resulting in program termination.
