This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programs:  subscript out of range errors caused by insufficient array bounds checking. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, which lacks proper validation to ensure array access is within the defined boundaries.  The `bugSolution.cob` file presents a corrected version with error handling to prevent unexpected program termination.
